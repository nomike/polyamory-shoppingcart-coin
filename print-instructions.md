This design requires multi material or multi extruder capabilities.

In Prusa Slicer, you can just import the heart. infinity and coin files simultaneously and you
will be asked whethere these are parts of the same object.

Prints very well with the MMU3 with all default settings.
I enabled ironing though for a much smoother top finish, but this increases print time a lot,
especially if you print multiple coins at once.

I will probably add a single extruder version of the coin soon.
